The recent pandemic has opened many avenues of research that were not previously considered. I, therefore, thought that it would be an interesting topic when I was looking for an idea for a new project. Furthermore, I was interested in working on a project related to time-series using Python as I have not used this coding language for this application before.

The outcome of this project was a workbook containing a small end-to-end data science project involving data manipulation, visualisations and  time-series analysis. The method used for analysing time-series was the ARIMA model. The resulting model was capable of accurately predicting covid levels with relatively low overall error. 

In terms of how this improved my skillset, this project furthered my knowledge of time-series analysis and introduced me to the ARIMA model which is a versatile and widely used model that I am sure I will use in the future. Additionally, it gave me more experience in working with real-life data and the necessary data preparation that must be done when working with real data.


This project was inspired by Keith Galli.

The code used for the ARIMA model was derived from Machine Learning Mastery:
