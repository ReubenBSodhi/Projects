This project was completed during my Data Science MSc in collaboration with one of my peers. The aim of this project was to find a suitable dataset to work with and consider what data science techniques could be used to better understand the data or provide further insight. Once this had been done these techniques were implemented in a workflow.
The data was obtained from the National Basketball Association (NBA) and consists of player data. Some variables include height, weight, country of origin and salary, to name a few. The techniques implemented in this project varied from performing visualisations of the data to variable correlation and player performance prediction.
The result of this project was a better overall understanding of the data as well as a series of tools which could be used to query the data and predict what future data from the same population may look like.
