This project was completed during my Data Science and Anlytics MSc in collaboration with one of my peers. We were asked to carry out a data science project from scratch with a data set that we had found. Me and my colleage decided to use data acquired from the National Basketball Association (NBA) and perform a range of different analytical techniques including visualisation, correlation between variables and prediction of player performance.
