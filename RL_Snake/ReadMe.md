This project is an exercise in reinforcement learning. Although this was taught in postgraduate degree it was covered only in a theoretical sense and was not applied in any pieces of coursework. I, therefore, thought that it would vastly increase my understanding of this subject if I were to attempt to create an application based on this theory. 

The chosen application of reinforcement learning was the game "Snake". The aim was to attempt to create a machine learning algorithm that could learn this game and maximise the score. This was done using Python and packages within this such as PyGame and PyTorch. 

This project resulted in an AI which was capable of optimising its behaviour in the game to maximise the score. Furthermore, this project solidified my understanding of reinforcement learning and gave me experience in practically applying the theory.

There are four code files: 
 - game.py (sets up the game and states rules of the game)
 - agent.py (encodes the rules which the agent follows according to RL)
 - model.py (sets up the neural network used in trainin)
 - helper.py (file used for plotting training graphs)

The code used in this prject is derived from Youtube videos created by Patrick Loeber.
